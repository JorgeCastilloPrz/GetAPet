    <string name="mock_description">Doggie is a white coloured shepherd dog. it is very lovely and It always licks my cheek. Doggie had been trained before ehile it is in the pet dog. So, it knows how to go back home, sit, stand and stay.

Doggie is special to me because it is just like my best friend. everytime when I come back from school, it will run out quickly to welcome me. it will jump onto my arm and lick my cheek. when I am free, I will play with Doggie in the garden. it will lie down on my feet, roll over and squirm around me until I give it a stomach rub. I am happy to have a friend who is never busy and can always play with me when I am lonely.
